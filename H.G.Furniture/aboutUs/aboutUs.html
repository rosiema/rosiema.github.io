    <h1>DESIGN</h1>
      <p>
        The first design ideas are developed through hand sketches and mood boards.<br />
        A design consultation is an opportunity to explore how you can turn your ideas into a reality. Whatever you want for your home, or office our skilled design consultants have the knowledge to make it happen, creating a solution that’s perfect for you and your lifestyle. The consultation is time to think big, explore the possibilities and define exactly what you want, in the comfort of your own home.
        We can work with photographs, technical drawings and renderings of your intended space; however, most of our clients prefer a personal visit from one of our designers, so we can really get a feel for your vision.<br />
        Fabrics, materials, budgets and technology will be discussed at this stage. <br />
        This will enable us to furnish you with an accurate quotation for the overall cost. Once the work has been commissioned full colour drawings or 3D renderings can be produced and materials schedule can be agreed upon prior to sign off.

    <h1>COMMISSIONING</h1>
    <p>
        When you are happy with the initial designs and are ready to proceed, we will officially commission the project. Once commissioned we then provide full, detailed technical CAD drawings to be signed off and confirmed. We can also produce full size templates where required.

    <h1>CRAFTING</h1>
    <p>
        When you are completely happy with the final design, the production will begin using some of the finest artisans in England. Our clients are informed of progress in all stages of the production.<br />
        We will closely work with any third parties involved with the project, such as interior designers, architects, builders or specialist consultants to ensure a smooth transition from the initial design through to delivery and installation.<br />
        We will oversee delivery and undertake the installation of manufactured pieces, ensuring that your new furniture is correctly and safely in place at the highest possible standards.
